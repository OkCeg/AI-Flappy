# AI-Flappy
Translated Code Bullet's AI Flappy Bird from JavaScript to C# in Unity.

This was mainly to get me started with AI, so credit for the code goes to Code Bullet.

The C# version I made: https://tbbm.itch.io/

Code Bullet's original video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WSW-5m8lRMs

Code Bullet's original GitHub: https://github.com/Code-Bullet/Flappy-Bird-AI

The first version in this includes the basic outline of sprites, prefabs, and scripts (that failed) and the 2.0 folder includes the actual network scripts.
